#Explanations of Blink_Variations:

**Blink_Variation_01**: Turns an LED on for one second, then off for one second, repeatedly.

**Blink_Variation_02**: The same as in Variation 1, but there's more blinks and they blink much faster.

**Blink_Variation_03**: Writes the name QUIM in morse code.

**Blink_Variation_03-Faster**: The same as in variation 3, but every time that it loops, it goes faster.
