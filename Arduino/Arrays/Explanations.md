# EXPLANATIONS of ARRAYS

## Explanation of Array 1:
This program defines two functions, **swapFirstTwoLetters** and **swapAandI**, which respectively swap the first two letters and 'a' with 'i' in a given string. 
In the **loop** function, it initializes a string variable **word** with the value "webi wabo", calls the two swap functions on it, and prints the modified 
string via Serial communication. This process repeats every second due to the delay(1000) statement in the loop.


## Explanation of Array 2:
This program initializes an array **grades** with 9 integer values representing grades. 
It then finds the minimum grade in the array using a **for** loop and prints the index of each occurrence where a grade is smaller than the current minimum. 
Finally, it prints the minimum grade found.
