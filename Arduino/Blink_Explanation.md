# Explanations of Blink_Variations:
---

**Blink_Variation_01**: The setup function initializes the LED pin, sets it as an output, and then performs the specified sequence of turning the LED on and off with specific delays. 
The loop function creates an infinite loop that blinks the LED with the specified timing pattern.

**Blink_Variation_02**: This sequence repeats indefinitely, creating a blinking effect where the LED is turned on for a short period, then off for the same duration. The result is a 
visually perceptible blinking pattern due to the alternating states of the LED.

**Blink_Variation_03**: This C++ code uses the Arduino framework to represent the Morse code for the word "QUIM" by flashing the built-in LED on pin 13 with dots, dashes, and pauses. 
After spelling "QUIM," the durations of dots, dashes, and pauses are halved to speed up the Morse code transmission, and the loop continues.

**Blink_Variation_03-Faster**: This program represents the Morse code for "QUIM" using the built-in LED, and after spelling the word, it speeds up the transmission by halving the 
durations of dots, dashes, and pauses. The loop continuously repeats this pattern.
