Explanations of CookingSystems

CookingSystem_1) this program works with serial, there's a readString and it makes that if you write "cook" the program will automatically write "has escrito: cook" and later will write in two different lines "we are deciding" and "we are cooking"
CookingSystem_2) this program is similar as the one before, but there's a recipee, a spanish omelette. Firstly, you will need to write "potato" and the program will automaticaly give you a potato, so now you can do the recipee. Secondly, you will write "cook" and the program will automaticaly write "has escrito: cook" and after it will write "we are deciding", the program will check if there's all the necessary things to make the spanish omelette, and if there are, it will write" we are cooking" and "you have a Spanish Omelette"
CookingSystem_2_My_Own_Recipee) this program is the same as the one before, but instead of a spanish omelette, is a sushi roll. So firtly, you will write "noriSeaweed" and you will automaticaly get a noriSeaweed, later you will write "salmon", and you will also get a salmon. Secondly, you will write "cook" and the program will write "you have written: cook", later it will write "we are deciding" and will check if there's everything to make the sushi roll, if there is, the program will write "we are making sushi" and "you have sushi".
