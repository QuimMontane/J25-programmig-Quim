Explanations of FunctionalProgramms:

FunctionalProgramming_1) Writes the name "QUIM" in morse code, the code is very extended, the loop is very large.

FunctionalProgramming_2) Basically is the same as the one before, but the loop is very short, because every thing is out the loop. 

FunctionalProgramming_5) Is the same as the FunctionalProgramming_2, but is with serial.
