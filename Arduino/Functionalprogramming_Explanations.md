# Explanations of FunctionalProgramms:

**FunctionalProgramming_1**: This program uses the built-in LED to transmit Morse code for the word "QUIM" in a loop. The Morse code for each letter is represented by a sequence of dots 
and dashes, with appropriate delays between them. The **dotDuration** variable determines the duration of a Morse code dot, and the LED blinks accordingly. The loop repeats, continually 
transmitting the Morse code pattern for the specified word.

**FunctionalProgramming_2**: (similar to the one before) This program uses Morse code to transmit the word "QUIM" using the built-in LED on the Arduino. The Morse code for each letter 
is represented by a sequence of dots and dashes, with appropriate delays between them. The **dotDuration** variable determines the duration of a Morse code dot, and the LED blinks 
accordingly. The loop repeats, continually transmitting the Morse code pattern for the specified word.

**OptionalFunctionalprogramming_3**: (similar to the one before) This program uses functions to transmit Morse code for the word "QUIM" using a modular approach. The **morseBlink** 
function is responsible for controlling the blinking pattern based on the number of dots specified for each letter. The **dotDuration** variable determines the duration of a Morse code 
dot, and the LED blinks accordingly. The loop repeats, continually transmitting the Morse code pattern for the specified word.

**FunctionalProgramming_5**: (similar to the one before, but using Serial) This program uses the Serial Monitor to display Morse code for the word "QUIM." Each letter is represented by 
dots and dashes, and a forward slash ("/") is printed at the end of each letter. After printing the Morse code for all the letters, there is a delay of 1000 milliseconds before the loop 
repeats.
