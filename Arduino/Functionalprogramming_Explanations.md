# Explanations of FunctionalProgramms:
---

**FunctionalProgramming_1**: Writes the name "QUIM" in morse code, the code is very extended, the loop is very large.

**FunctionalProgramming_2**: Basically is the same as the one before, but the loop is very short, because every thing is out the loop. 

**OptionalFunctionalprogramming_3**: is the same as FunctionalProgramming_2, but works with the numbre of dots and slashes, 
bascilally, you put the number of dots or slashes each letter have, and the program will automaticaly do "NumberOfDots*dotDuration", 
and with the delay works almost the same, you put "delay(dotDuration*(the number of spaces you want))".

**FunctionalProgramming_5**: Is the same as the FunctionalProgramming_2, but is with serial.
