# Explanation of MySpecialMessage:

**MySpecialFunction**: This program works with serial, the objective is to print the charaters line by line until creating a 2D drawing, in 
my case, I wanted to draw a Freddy from Five Nights at Freddy's, it will print it indefinitely, but everytime it prints it, there will be a 
delay of 2000 miliseconds, there's 10 "\n" to clear the serial monitor.
