## Coding Vocabulary📜
---
👍🏼👍🏼Here are some popular coding terms and words to become familiar with:👍🏼👍🏼
---


**Algorithm**

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.


**Arrays**

Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the 
animals in cages are the variables inside. 


**Bit**

The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits. 


**Block Coding**

With block-based coding, programming "blocks" fit together like puzzle pieces. When you code with blocks, you take the first block you want the program to execute and attach it to 
another block, and so on. 


**C++**

C++ is a low-level yet versatile programming language. Beginnners who master this language will be able to solve complex problems and understand how programs work.

**Camel case**

Variables should be named using camel case, meaning the first word of the name is lowercase and each new word after that is capitalized. It's called camel case because when it was 
originally written as CamelCase, the capital Cs look like the humps on a camel. iPhone, eBay, YouTube, and of course, iD in “iD Tech” are real-world examples of camel casing!


**Coding**

Coding is how people create instructions for computers to follow. Just like people speak different languages, so do programs. For instance, Roblox uses the coding language Lua while 
Minecraft was built with Java. 


**Coding languages** 

Computers use coding languages to understand what people want them to do. Just like how people communicate with each other in English or Japanese, people communicate with computers in 
languages like C++ or Java. Some of the best coding languages for kids include JavaScript, Scratch, and Python.


**Conditional statements**

Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Use them to print information or move programs forward in different situations.


**Else statements**

Else statements are used to do something else when the condition in the if statement isn't true.


**Else if statements**

Use an else if statement to do something when the if statement's condition isn't true but before the else statement. Else if statements also check a specific condition.


**For loops**

For loops allow you to run a block of code repeatedly, just like while loops. However, for loops run a block of code a set number of times. (Remember, while loops run an unknown or 
unspecified amount of times; more on that below.)


**Functions**

A function is a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains. 


**If statements**

An if statement runs a block of code based on whether or not a condition is true.


**Increment and decrement operators**

Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators add or subtract one from the numerical value of the variable they're adjacent to. They're useful for situations when you only want to change 
a value by exactly one, like leveling up or using a life.


**Input**

Input is any interaction from the user to the program. In video games, this includes using the keyboard to move or using the mouse to look around.


**Integrated Development Environment**

Software such as Visual Studio is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is where you type your code and run your programs. Basically, an IDE is software that 
makes coding simpler.


**Java**

Java is a powerful multi-platform programming language. It's used for many professional and commercial applications, including every Android application and even the Android operating 
system itself! 

Minecraft was completely developed in Java by Markus Persson. Gmail was created in Java because Java has a great performance rate and a good framework for web. 


**JavaScript**

There are a lot of different text programming languages programmers can use, and JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. It is used in 95% of websites and can be 
used for programming phones and robots. 


**Library**

A library is a collection of code made by other programmers for you to import and use.


**Loops**

Loops check a condition and then run a code block. The loop will continue to check and run until a specified condition is reached. 


**Main function**

For a program to run, it must have a main function, which runs first each time you start your program. The main function is where the bulk of your code will go.


**Python**

Python is a programming language that’s currently becoming more and more powerful with every new library added to its collection. It handles everything from web development and game 
design, to machine learning and AI. Python is known for having syntax that's simpler and easier to write than many other languages like Java and C++.


**Scratch**

Scratch coding is an MIT-developed graphical programming language, where beginners can learn drag-and-drop programming basics to create interactive stories and comics.


**Scripts**

In programming, a series of scripts, or sets of steps, are written for a computer to follow. Computers process the steps line-by-line from top to bottom. Each step is created by 
writing a statement. 


**Statement**

The way you tell a computer to perform an action is by giving it instructions or writing statements to explain a desired action. Again, it’s similar to writing sentences in English, 
but with words, numbers, and punctuation added depending on the programming language.


**Strings**

Variables can hold data besides numbers, including words. Programmers refer to variables holding words as strings.


**Variable**

A variable is a container that holds a single number, word, or other information that you can use throughout a program. A variable is like a chest you can fill with different values. 
You name the chests so you can find them later. Variables have three parts: type, name, and value.


**Variable types**

Once a variable is declared, a variable type is specified. Basic variable types include: string (words and phrases), char (short for “character;” a single letter or symbol you can 
type), int (short for “integer;” for whole numbers), double or float (for decimal numbers), and bool (short for “boolean;” for true or false values).


**Visual Studio**

Visual Studio is used to program in C++. It’s an industry-wide platform with many tools and features to help you! 


**While loops**

While loops are set up just like if statements. They check for a condition and run the code in them until the condition is no longer true. A while loop will run forever (until the 
condition is false).

## Function Syntax in C++

**Definition:** 
return_type name(parameters)

**Void Function:** 
void nameOfTheFunction() { code }

**No spaces** 
allowed in the parameters.


## Calling a Function:
```C++
nameOfTheFunction();
morse_J(); //example
```

## Example of Functions:
º) digitalWrite(int pin, 1 or 0)
º) delay()
º) pinMode(<pin>, <mode>)

## Important⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
We cannot define a function inside the definition of another function.

## Example of Setup and Loop Functions
```C++
void setup() {
  // Setup code
}

void loop() {
  // Looping code
}
```

## ❌Booleans✅ 
Booleans are variables that can be true or false.

## Operators of Comparison
```C++
if (condition) {
  // Code executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code executed if the condition is false
}
// Code executed in both cases
```
## Determining if the Condition is True
We use a boolean. If the boolean value is true, the condition is true. If the boolean value is false, then the condition is not met.
```
Bool me(gusta Picasso = false;
If(meGustaPicasso) {
goToMuseumPicasso();
}
else {goToDesignMuseum();}
```
## 🔔Types of notation🔔
º) camelCase → Methods and variables
º) PascalCase → Obejcts
º) Kebab-case → URL
º) Snake_case
º) SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE → Constants

## Nested If (Example)
"If" that are inside other "If"
```C++
if (patatas) {
  if (huevos) {
    Tortilla();
  }
  Freir();
} else {
  pedirSushi();
}
```
| 🥚🍳Huevos🍳🥚 | 🥔Patatas🥔 | Execution |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| False           | False        | ps;       |
| False           | True         | f;        |
| True            | False        | ps;       |
| True            | True         | t;f;      |

## Boolean Variable (bool)
If the variable value is true, then we go inside the if. If the variable value is false, then we don’t go inside the if. If there is an else, we go inside the else.

## Else if
Else if is an extra condition. Programming languages need to be consistent and univocal. That’s why we use = for assignment and == for comparison.

## Comparators
º) == : Compare if same value
º) != : Different value
º) < : Lesser than
º) <= : Lesser or equal than
º) ">": Greater than
º) ">=": Greater or equal than

## Combo Burger (Boolean Operators)
º) &&: AND operator
º) ||: OR operator
º) !: NOT operator
```c++
//eggsInTheFridge
//potatoesInTheKitchen

if(eggsInTheFridge && potatoesInTheKitchen) {
   cookSpanishOmelette();
}
```
```c++
if(cocoaOpen || titusOpen) {
       goToDisco();
}
```
```c++
If ((eggsInTheFridge && potatoesInTheKitchen) || sausagesInTheKitchen) {
    cookSomeThing();
}
else (goToKebab)();}
```
```c++
if (¡eggsInTheFridge) {
    goToBuySomeEggs();
}
```
```c++
If(TRdelivered && meanGrade >= 5 && allFinalTestPassed)
(deliveredBachilleratoTitle());}
```

# 🥷🕸️Scope in PL🕸️🥷
// extended info from class
---

## Introduction
In programming languages, scope defines the region of the program where a specific variable can be accessed or modified.

## Global Scope
Variables declared outside any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the program, including within functions and blocks.

```C++
int globalVariable = 10;  // Global variable
void setup(){
//code
}
```

## Local Scope
Variables declared within a function or block have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific function or block.

```C++
void setup(){
  // Local variable
  int localVar = 20;
  // localVar is only accessible within this block
}
```

## Function Scope
Parameters and variables declared in a function have function scope. They are accessible only within the function where they are declared.

```C++
void exampleFunction(int parameter) {
    // parameter and localVariable have function scope
    int localVariable = parameter + 5;
}
```

## Block Scope
Variables declared within a block of code (inside curly braces {}) have block scope. They are only accessible within that specific block.

```C++
int main() {
    // outerVar is accessible within this block
    int outerVar = 30;

    {
        // innerVar is only accessible within this nested block
        int innerVar = 40;
    }

    // Attempting to access innerVar here would result in an error
    return 0;
}
```

# 🪢Strings🕹️
// extended info from class
---

## Introduction
In programming, a string is a sequence of characters. It is a fundamental data type used to represent text. Strings are commonly manipulated for tasks such as input/output, text processing, and data storage.

## Declaration and Initialization
```C++
// Declaration and initialization of strings
std::string greeting = "Hello, ";
std::string name = "World!";
```

## Concatenation
Strings can be combined using the + operator, a process known as concatenation.
```C++
std::string message = greeting + name; // Results in "Hello, World!"
```

## String Length
The length of a string can be obtained using the length() or size() member functions.
```C++
int length = message.length(); // Length is 13
```

## Substrings
Portions of a string can be extracted using the substr() function.
```C++
std::string sub = message.substr(7, 5); // Extracts "World"
```

## String Comparison
Strings can be compared using relational operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=).
```C++
bool isEqual = (greeting == name); // Evaluates to false
```

## String Manipulation
Various functions are available for manipulating strings, such as finding substrings, replacing characters, and converting case.
```C++
// Example: Converting to uppercase
std::transform(message.begin(), message.end(), message.begin(), ::toupper);
```
