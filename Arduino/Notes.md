Algorithm
An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.

Arrays
Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the animals in cages are the variables inside. 

Bit
The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits. 

Block Coding
With block-based coding, programming "blocks" fit together like puzzle pieces. When you code with blocks, you take the first block you want the program to execute and attach it to another block, and so on. 

C++
C++ is a low-level yet versatile programming language. Beginnners who master this language will be able to solve complex problems and understand how programs work.

Camel case
Variables should be named using camel case, meaning the first word of the name is lowercase and each new word after that is capitalized. It's called camel case because when it was originally written as CamelCase, the capital Cs look like the humps on a camel. iPhone, eBay, YouTube, and of course, iD in ‚ÄúiD Tech‚Äù are real-world examples of camel casing!

Coding
Coding is how people create instructions for computers to follow. Just like people speak different languages, so do programs. For instance, Roblox uses the coding language Lua while Minecraft was built with Java. 

Coding languages 
Computers use coding languages to understand what people want them to do. Just like how people communicate with each other in English or Japanese, people communicate with computers in languages like C++ or Java. Some of the best coding languages for kids include JavaScript, Scratch, and Python.

Conditional statements
Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Use them to print information or move programs forward in different situations.

Else statements
Else statements are used to do something else when the condition in the if statement isn't true.

Else if statements
Use an else if statement to do something when the if statement's condition isn't true but before the else statement. Else if statements also check a specific condition.

For loops
For loops allow you to run a block of code repeatedly, just like while loops. However, for loops run a block of code a set number of times. (Remember, while loops run an unknown or unspecified amount of times; more on that below.)

Functions
A function is a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains. 

If statements
An if statement runs a block of code based on whether or not a condition is true.

Increment and decrement operators
Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators add or subtract one from the numerical value of the variable they're adjacent to. They're useful for situations when you only want to change a value by exactly one, like leveling up or using a life.

Input
Input is any interaction from the user to the program. In video games, this includes using the keyboard to move or using the mouse to look around.

Integrated Development Environment 
Software such as Visual Studio is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is where you type your code and run your programs. Basically, an IDE is software that makes coding simpler.

Java
Java is a powerful multi-platform programming language. It's used for many professional and commercial applications, including every Android application and even the Android operating system itself! 

Minecraft was completely developed in Java by Markus Persson. Gmail was created in Java because Java has a great performance rate and a good framework for web. 

When it comes to Java for kids, they can use Java to make a wide range of games and programs.

JavaScript
There are a lot of different text programming languages programmers can use, and JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. It is used in 95% of websites and can be used for programming phones and robots. 

Library
A library is a collection of code made by other programmers for you to import and use.

Loops
Loops check a condition and then run a code block. The loop will continue to check and run until a specified condition is reached. 

Main function
For a program to run, it must have a main function, which runs first each time you start your program. The main function is where the bulk of your code will go.

Python
Python is a programming language that‚Äôs currently becoming more and more powerful with every new library added to its collection. It handles everything from web development and game design, to machine learning and AI. Python is known for having syntax that's simpler and easier to write than many other languages like Java and C++.

Scratch
Scratch coding is an MIT-developed graphical programming language, where beginners can learn drag-and-drop programming basics to create interactive stories and comics.

Scripts
In programming, a series of scripts, or sets of steps, are written for a computer to follow. Computers process the steps line-by-line from top to bottom. Each step is created by writing a statement. 

Statement
The way you tell a computer to perform an action is by giving it instructions or writing statements to explain a desired action. Again, it‚Äôs similar to writing sentences in English, but with words, numbers, and punctuation added depending on the programming language.

Strings
Variables can hold data besides numbers, including words. Programmers refer to variables holding words as strings.

Variable
A variable is a container that holds a single number, word, or other information that you can use throughout a program. A variable is like a chest you can fill with different values. You name the chests so you can find them later. Variables have three parts: type, name, and value.

Variable types
Once a variable is declared, a variable type is specified. Basic variable types include: string (words and phrases), char (short for ‚Äúcharacter;‚Äù a single letter or symbol you can type), int (short for ‚Äúinteger;‚Äù for whole numbers), double or float (for decimal numbers), and bool (short for ‚Äúboolean;‚Äù for true or false values).

Visual Studio
Visual Studio is used to program in C++. It‚Äôs an industry-wide platform with many tools and features to help you! 

While loops
While loops are set up just like if statements. They check for a condition and run the code in them until the condition is no longer true. A while loop will run forever (until the condition is false).
