## Coding Vocabulary📜
---
👍🏼👍🏼Here are some popular coding terms and words to become familiar with:👍🏼👍🏼
---


**Algorithm**

An algorithm is a set of instructions that are followed to solve a problem. It's a computer's thought process.


**Arrays**

Arrays are containers that hold variables; they're used to group together similar variables. You can think of arrays like shelves at a pet store. The array would be the shelf, and the 
animals in cages are the variables inside. 


**Bit**

The individual 1's and 0's you see in binary are called bits. 


**Block Coding**

With block-based coding, programming "blocks" fit together like puzzle pieces. When you code with blocks, you take the first block you want the program to execute and attach it to 
another block, and so on. 


**C++**

C++ is a low-level yet versatile programming language. Beginnners who master this language will be able to solve complex problems and understand how programs work.

**Camel case**

Variables should be named using camel case, meaning the first word of the name is lowercase and each new word after that is capitalized. It's called camel case because when it was 
originally written as CamelCase, the capital Cs look like the humps on a camel. iPhone, eBay, YouTube, and of course, iD in “iD Tech” are real-world examples of camel casing!


**Coding**

Coding is how people create instructions for computers to follow. Just like people speak different languages, so do programs. For instance, Roblox uses the coding language Lua while 
Minecraft was built with Java. 


**Coding languages** 

Computers use coding languages to understand what people want them to do. Just like how people communicate with each other in English or Japanese, people communicate with computers in 
languages like C++ or Java. Some of the best coding languages for kids include JavaScript, Scratch, and Python.


**Conditional statements**

Conditional statements evaluate to true or false. Use them to print information or move programs forward in different situations.


**Else statements**

Else statements are used to do something else when the condition in the if statement isn't true.


**Else if statements**

Use an else if statement to do something when the if statement's condition isn't true but before the else statement. Else if statements also check a specific condition.


**For loops**

For loops allow you to run a block of code repeatedly, just like while loops. However, for loops run a block of code a set number of times. (Remember, while loops run an unknown or 
unspecified amount of times; more on that below.)


**Functions**

A function is a block of code that can be referenced by name to run the code it contains. 


**If statements**

An if statement runs a block of code based on whether or not a condition is true.


**Increment and decrement operators**

Increment (++) and decrement (--) operators add or subtract one from the numerical value of the variable they're adjacent to. They're useful for situations when you only want to change 
a value by exactly one, like leveling up or using a life.


**Input**

Input is any interaction from the user to the program. In video games, this includes using the keyboard to move or using the mouse to look around.


**Integrated Development Environment**

Software such as Visual Studio is known as an Integrated Development Environment (IDE), which is where you type your code and run your programs. Basically, an IDE is software that 
makes coding simpler.


**Java**

Java is a powerful multi-platform programming language. It's used for many professional and commercial applications, including every Android application and even the Android operating 
system itself! 

Minecraft was completely developed in Java by Markus Persson. Gmail was created in Java because Java has a great performance rate and a good framework for web. 


**JavaScript**

There are a lot of different text programming languages programmers can use, and JavaScript is one of the most popular programming languages. It is used in 95% of websites and can be 
used for programming phones and robots. 


**Library**

A library is a collection of code made by other programmers for you to import and use.


**Loops**

Loops check a condition and then run a code block. The loop will continue to check and run until a specified condition is reached. 


**Main function**

For a program to run, it must have a main function, which runs first each time you start your program. The main function is where the bulk of your code will go.


**Python**

Python is a programming language that’s currently becoming more and more powerful with every new library added to its collection. It handles everything from web development and game 
design, to machine learning and AI. Python is known for having syntax that's simpler and easier to write than many other languages like Java and C++.


**Scratch**

Scratch coding is an MIT-developed graphical programming language, where beginners can learn drag-and-drop programming basics to create interactive stories and comics.


**Scripts**

In programming, a series of scripts, or sets of steps, are written for a computer to follow. Computers process the steps line-by-line from top to bottom. Each step is created by 
writing a statement. 


**Statement**

The way you tell a computer to perform an action is by giving it instructions or writing statements to explain a desired action. Again, it’s similar to writing sentences in English, 
but with words, numbers, and punctuation added depending on the programming language.


**Strings**

Variables can hold data besides numbers, including words. Programmers refer to variables holding words as strings.


**Variable**

A variable is a container that holds a single number, word, or other information that you can use throughout a program. A variable is like a chest you can fill with different values. 
You name the chests so you can find them later. Variables have three parts: type, name, and value.


**Variable types**

Once a variable is declared, a variable type is specified. Basic variable types include: string (words and phrases), char (short for “character;” a single letter or symbol you can 
type), int (short for “integer;” for whole numbers), double or float (for decimal numbers), and bool (short for “boolean;” for true or false values).


**Visual Studio**

Visual Studio is used to program in C++. It’s an industry-wide platform with many tools and features to help you! 


**While loops**

While loops are set up just like if statements. They check for a condition and run the code in them until the condition is no longer true. A while loop will run forever (until the 
condition is false).

## Function Syntax in C++


**Definition:** 
return_type name(parameters)


**Void Function:** 
void nameOfTheFunction() { code }


**No spaces** 
allowed in the parameters.


## Calling a Function:
```C++
nameOfTheFunction();
morse_J(); //example
```


## Example of Functions:

º) digitalWrite(int pin, 1 or 0)

º) delay()

º) pinMode(<pin>, <mode>)


## Important⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️⚠️
We cannot define a function inside the definition of another function.


## Example of Setup and Loop Functions
```C++
void setup() {
  // Setup code
}

void loop() {
  // Looping code
}
```

## ❌Booleans✅ 
Booleans are variables that can be true or false.


## Operators of Comparison
```C++
if (condition) {
  // Code executed if the condition is true
} else {
  // Code executed if the condition is false
}
// Code executed in both cases
```

## Determining if the Condition is True
We use a boolean. If the boolean value is true, the condition is true. If the boolean value is false, then the condition is not met.
```
Bool me(gusta Picasso = false;
If(meGustaPicasso) {
goToMuseumPicasso();
}
else {goToDesignMuseum();}
```

## 🔔Types of notation🔔

º) camelCase → Methods and variables

º) PascalCase → Obejcts

º) Kebab-case → URL

º) Snake_case

º) SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE → Constants


## Nested If (Example)
"If" that are inside other "If"
```C++
if (patatas) {
  if (huevos) {
    Tortilla();
  }
  Freir();
} else {
  pedirSushi();
}
```
| 🥚🍳Huevos🍳🥚 | 🥔Patatas🥔 | Execution |
| --------------- | ------------ | --------- |
| False           | False        | ps;       |
| False           | True         | f;        |
| True            | False        | ps;       |
| True            | True         | t;f;      |

## Boolean Variable (bool)
If the variable value is true, then we go inside the if. If the variable value is false, then we don’t go inside the if. If there is an else, we go inside the else.


## Else if
Else if is an extra condition. Programming languages need to be consistent and univocal. That’s why we use = for assignment and == for comparison.


## Comparators

º) == : Compare if same value

º) != : Different value

º) < : Lesser than

º) <= : Lesser or equal than

º) ">": Greater than

º) ">=": Greater or equal than


## Combo Burger (Boolean Operators)

º) &&: AND operator

º) ||: OR operator

º) !: NOT operator

```c++
//eggsInTheFridge
//potatoesInTheKitchen

if(eggsInTheFridge && potatoesInTheKitchen) {
   cookSpanishOmelette();
}
```
```c++
if(cocoaOpen || titusOpen) {
       goToDisco();
}
```
```c++
If ((eggsInTheFridge && potatoesInTheKitchen) || sausagesInTheKitchen) {
    cookSomeThing();
}
else (goToKebab)();}
```
```c++
if (¡eggsInTheFridge) {
    goToBuySomeEggs();
}
```
```c++
If(TRdelivered && meanGrade >= 5 && allFinalTestPassed)
(deliveredBachilleratoTitle());}

# 🥷🕸️Scope in PL🕸️🥷
// extended info from class made by **Spaikyjordi**
---

## Introduction

In programming languages, scope defines the region of the program where a specific variable can be accessed or modified.

## Global Scope

Variables declared outside any function or block have global scope. They can be accessed from any part of the program, including within functions and blocks.

```C++
int globalVariable = 10;  // Global variable
void setup(){
//code
}
```

## Local Scope

Variables declared within a function or block have local scope. They are only accessible within that specific function or block.

```C++
void setup(){
  // Local variable
  int localVar = 20;
  // localVar is only accessible within this block
}
```

## Function Scope

Parameters and variables declared in a function have function scope. They are accessible only within the function where they are declared.

```C++
void exampleFunction(int parameter) {
    // parameter and localVariable have function scope
    int localVariable = parameter + 5;
}
```

## Block Scope

Variables declared within a block of code (inside curly braces {}) have block scope. They are only accessible within that specific block.

```C++
int main() {
    // outerVar is accessible within this block
    int outerVar = 30;

    {
        // innerVar is only accessible within this nested block
        int innerVar = 40;
    }

    // Attempting to access innerVar here would result in an error
    return 0;
}
```

## C++ Strings

One of the most useful data types supplied in the C++ libraries is the string. A string is a
variable that stores a sequence of letters or other characters, such as **"Hello"** or
**"May 10th is my birthday!"**. Just like the other data types, to create a **string** we
first declare it, then we can store a value in it.

**string testString;**
**testString = "This is a string.";**

We can combine these two statements into one line:

**string testString = "This is a string.";**

Often, we use strings as output, and **cout** works exactly like one would expect:

**cout << testString << endl;**

will print the same result as

**cout << "This is a string." << endl;**

In order to use the string data type, the C++ string header **<string>** must be included at
the top of the program. Also, you’ll need to include **using namespace std;** to make
the short name **string** visible instead of requiring the cumbersome **std::string**. (As a
side note, **std** is a C++ namespace for many pieces of functionality that are provided in
standard C++ libraries. For the purposes of this class, you won't need to otherwise know
about namespaces.) Thus, you would have the following **#include's** in your program in
order to use the **string** type.

**#include <string>**
**using namespace std;**

**Basic Operations**
Let’s go into specifics about the string manipulations you’ll be doing the most.

**Counting the number of characters in a string**. The **length** method returns the number
of characters in a string, including spaces and punctuation. Like many of the string
operations, **length** is a member function, and we invoke member functions using dot
notation. The string that is the receiver is to the left of the dot, the member function we are
invoking is to the right, (e.g. **str.length()**). In such an expression, we are requesting
the length from the variable **str**.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
string small, large;
small = "I am short";
large = "I, friend, am a long and elaborate string indeed";
cout << "The short string is " << small.length()
 << " characters." << endl;
cout << The long string is " << large.length()
 << " characters." << endl;
return 0;
}
```

output:
```C++
The short string is 10 characters.
The long string is 48 characters.
```

**Accessing individual characters**. Using square brackets, you can access individual
characters within a string as if it’s a **char** array. Positions within a string **str** are
numbered from 0 through **str.length() - 1**. You can read and write to characters
within a string using **[]**.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"
int main() {
string test;
test = "I am Q the omnipot3nt";
char ch = test[5]; // ch is 'Q'
test[18] = 'e'; // we correct misspelling of omnipotent
cout << test << endl;
cout << "ch = " << ch << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
I am Q the omnipotent
ch = Q
```

Be careful not to access positions outside the bounds of the string. The square bracket
operator is not range-checked and thus reading from or writing to an out-of-bounds index
tends to produce difficult-to-track-down errors. There is an alternate member function

**at(int index)** that retrieves the character at a position with the benefit of built-in
range-checking, but it’s used much less often.

**Passing, returning, assigning strings**. C++ strings are designed to behave like ordinary
primitive types with regard to assignment. Assigning one string to another makes a deep
copy of the character sequence.

string str1 = "hello";
string str2 = str1; // makes a new copy
str1[0] = 'y'; // changes str1, but not str2

Passing and returning strings from functions clones the string. If you change a string
parameter within a function, changes are not seen in the calling function unless you have
specifically passed the string by reference (e.g. using that **&** trick we learned about in the
Queen Safety example.)

**Comparing two strings**. You can compare two strings for equality using the == and !=
operators. Suppose you ask the user for his or her name. If the user is Julie, the program
prints a warm welcome. If the user is not Neal, the program prints the normal message.
Finally… if the user is Neal, it prints a less enthusiastic response.

**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"
#include "simpio.h"

int main() {
string myName = "Neal";
while (true) {
cout << "Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit): ";
string userName = getLine();
if (userName == "Julie") {
cout << "Hi, Julie! Welcome back!" << endl;
} else if (userName == "quit") {
// user is sick of entering names, so let's quit
cout << endl;
break;
} else if (userName != myName) {
// user did not enter quit, Julie, or Neal
cout << "Hello, " << userName << endl;
} else {
cout << "Oh, it’s you, " << myName << endl;
}
}
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit): Neal
Oh, it's you, Neal
Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit): Julie
Hi, Julie! Welcome back!
Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit): Leland
Hello, Leland
Enter your name (or 'quit' to exit): quit
```

You can use <, <=, >, and >= to compare strings as well. These operators compare strings
lexicographically, character by character and are case-sensitive. The following
comparisons all evaluate to true: **"A" < "B", "App" < "Apple",
"help" > "hello", "Apple" < "apple"**. The last one might be a bit confusing, but
the ASCII value for '**A**' is 65, and comes before '**a**', whose ASCII value is 97. So
"**Apple**" comes before "**apple**" (or, for that matter, any other word that starts with a
lower-case letter).

**Appending to a string:** C++ strings are wondrous things. Suppose you have two strings, **s1**
and **s2** and you want to create a new string of their concatenation. Conveniently, you can
just write **s1 + s2**, and you’ll get the result you’d expect. Similarly, if you want to append
to the end of string, you can use the **+=** operator. You can append either another string or
a single character to the end of a string.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
string firstname = "Leland";
string lastname = " Stanford";
string fullname = firstname + lastname; // concat the two strings
fullname += ", Jr"; // append another string
 fullname += '.'; // append a single char
cout << firstname << lastname << endl;
cout << fullname << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
Leland Stanford
Leland Stanford, Jr.
```

**More (Less Used) Operations**
The string class has many more operations; we’ll show just a few of the more useful ones
below.

**Searching within a string**. The string member function **find** is used to search within a
string for a particular string or character. A sample usage such as **str.find(key)**
searches the receiver string **str** for the **key**. The parameter **key** can either be a string or a
character. (We say the **find** member function is overloaded to allow more than one
usage). The return value is either the starting position where the key was found or the
constant **string::npos** which indicates the key was not found.

Occasionally, you’ll want to control what part of the string is searched, such as to find a
second occurrence past the first. There is an optional second integer argument to **find**
which allows you to specify the starting position; when this argument is not given, 0 is
assumed. Thus, **str.find(key, n)** starts at position **n** within **str** and will attempt to
find **key** from that point on. The following code should make this slightly clearer:


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
string sentence = "Yes, we went to Gates after we left the dorm.";

int firstWe = sentence.find("we"); // finds the first "we"
int secondWe = sentence.find("we", firstWe + 1); // finds "we" in "went"
int thirdWe = sentence.find("we", secondWe + 1); // finds the last "we"
int gPos = sentence.find('G');
int zPos = sentence.find('Z'); // returns string::npos

cout << "First we: " << firstWe << endl;
cout << "Second we: " << secondWe << endl;
cout << "Third we: " << thirdWe << endl;
cout << "Is G there? ";
cout << (gPos != string::npos ? "Yes!" : "No!") << endl;
cout << "Is Z there? ";
cout << (wPos != string::npos ? "Yes!" : "No!") << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
First we: 5
Second we: 8
Third we: 28
Is G there? Yes!
Is Z there? No!
```

**Extracting substrings**. Sometimes you would like to create new strings by extracting
portions of a larger one. The **substr** member function creates substrings from pieces of 
the receiver string. You specify the starting position and the number of characters. For
example, **str.substr(start, length)** returns a new string consisting of the
characters from str starting at the position **start** and continuing for **length** characters.
Invoking this member function does not change the receiver string, as it makes a new string
with a copy of the characters specified.

**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
string oldSentence;
oldSentence = "The quick brown fox jumped WAY over the lazy dog";
int len = oldSentence.length();
cout << "Original sentence: " << oldSentence << endl;
int found = oldSentence.find("WAY ");
string newSentence = oldSentence.substr(0, found);
cout << "Modified sentence: " << newSentence << endl;
newSentence += oldSentence.substr(found + 4);
cout << "Completed sentence: " << newSentence << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
Original sentence: The quick brown fox jumped WAY over the lazy dog
Modified sentence: The quick brown fox jumped
Completed sentence: The quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
```

There are a couple of special cases for **substr(start, length).** If **start** is negative,
it will cause a run-time error. If **start** is past the end of the string, it will return an empty
string (e.g., ""). If **length** is longer than the number of characters from the start position
to the end of the string, it truncates to the end of the string. If **length** is negative, then the
behavior is undefined, so make sure that **length** is always non-negative. If you leave off
the second argument, the number of characters from the starting position to the end of the
receiver string is assumed.

**Modifying a string by inserting and replacing**. Finally, let’s cover two other useful member
functions that modify the receiver string. The first, **str1.insert(start, str2)**,
inserts **str2** at position **start** within **str1**, shifting the remaining characters of **str1**
over. The second, **str1.replace(start, length, str2)**, removes from **str1** a
total of **length** characters starting at the position **start**, replacing them with a copy of
**str2**. It is important to note that these member functions do modify the receiver string.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
string sentence = "CS106B sucks.";
cout << sentence << endl;
// Insert "kind of" at position 8 in sentence
sentence.insert(7, "kind of ");
cout << sentence << endl;
// Replace the 10 characters "kind of su"
 // with the string "ro" in sentence
sentence.replace(7, 10, "ro");
cout << sentence << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
CS106B sucks.
CS106B kind of sucks.
CS106B rocks.
```

**Obtaining a C-style char * from a string**
Remember, a C++ string is not the same thing as a C-style string (which is merely a
**char** * pointer to a sequence of characters terminated by a null character **'\0'**).
Although old-style C **char** * strings and C++ strings can co-exist in a program, almost all
our use will be of C++ strings, since they have a much richer set of operations and are less
error-prone to work with. I say "almost always" because in a few unavoidable situations,
we are forced to use old-style C strings, most notably when working with file streams. We
can convert a C++ string to the old-style representation using the **.c_str()** member
function. One use we will see of this is to get a **char** * to pass to the **iostream::open**
function.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
#include <fstream>
using namespace std;

#include "console.h"

int main() {
ifstream fs;
string filename = "courseinfo.txt";
string s;
// open function requires a C-style string, must convert!
fs.open(filename.c_str());
if (fs.fail()) return -1; // could not open the file!
// process the file
fs.close();
return 0;
}
```

**The CS106 Library: strlib.h**
In addition to the standard library support for strings, there are a few extensions that the
CS106 libraries provide. To use these functions, the **strlib.h** library must be
**#include**d.

**integerToString, realToString, stringToInteger, stringToReal:** 
Often your programs will need to convert a string to a number or vice versa. These functions do
just that, with the 'integer' functions operating on **int** and the 'real' functions on **double**.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "genlib.h"
#include "strlib.h"

int main() {
string str1 = "5.6";
double num = stringToReal(str1);
string str2 = integerToString(45);

cout << "The original string is " << str1 << "." << endl;
cout << "The number is " << num << "." << endl;
cout << "The new string is " << str2 << "." << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
The original string is 5.6.
The number is 5.6
The new string is 45.
```

Any integer or real can be safely converted to a string. However, when converting in the
other direction, if you pass an improperly formatted string to convert to an integer or real,
an error is raised by the conversion functions.

**topUpperCase, toLowerCase:** These functions take a string, and return a new string
with all letters in lower or upper case respectively. These can be used to change two
strings to a uniform case before comparing to allow a case-insensitive comparison.


**example program:**
```C++
#include <string>
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

#include "genlib.h"
#include "strlib.h"

int main() {
string appleFruit = "apples";
string orangeFruit = "ORANGES";

cout << "Do " << appleFruit << " come before " << orangeFruit << "? ";
cout << (appleFruit < orangeFruit ? "Yes!" : "Nope....") << endl;

string lowerOrangeFruit = toLowerCase(orangeFruit);

cout << "Do " << appleFruit << " come before " << lowerOrangeFruit << "? ";
cout << (appleFruit < lowerOrangeFruit ? "Yes!" : "Nope....") << endl;
return 0;
}
```

**output:**
```C++
Do apples come before ORANGES? Nope....
Do apples come before oranges? Yes!
```

There are a few other functions within the **strlib** library (**equalsIgnoreCase,
startsWith, endsWith**, and **trim**) as well.
