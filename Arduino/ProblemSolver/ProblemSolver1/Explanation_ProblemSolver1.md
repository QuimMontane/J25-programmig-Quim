# Explanation of ProblemSolver1
---

When the Arduino is powered up or reset, it will enter the setup function, initialize serial communication, 
and then enter a loop that solves 30 problems by calling the resolverProblemaDibujo function for each problem, 
printing a corresponding message to the serial monitor. The loop function, although defined, is empty in this code.
