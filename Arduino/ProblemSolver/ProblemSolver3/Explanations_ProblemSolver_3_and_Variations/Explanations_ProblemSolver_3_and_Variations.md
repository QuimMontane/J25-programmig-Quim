## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3

the program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems that are divisible by both 4 and 6. 
The conditions inside the loop (n % 4 == 0 && n % 6 == 0) ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the 
resolverProblemaDibujo function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.
