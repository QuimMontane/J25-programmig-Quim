## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3

the program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems that are divisible by both 4 and 6. 
The conditions inside the loop (n % 4 == 0 && n % 6 == 0) ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the 
resolverProblemaDibujo function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.


## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3_ejemplo_1

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems that are multiples of 7 and not multiples of 14. The conditions inside the loop (**n % 7 == 0 && 
 n % 14 != 0**) ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.


## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3_ejemplo_2

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems that are odd, divisible by 3, and prime. The conditions inside the loop and the helper function 
 **esPrimo** ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.

 
## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3_ejemplo_3

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 30 but only for the problems that are multiples of 7. The condition inside the loop (**n % 7 == 0**) ensures that only numbers 
meeting this criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.


## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3_ejemplo_4

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 30 but only for the problems where the last digit is either 3 or 6. The condition inside the loop (**n % 10 == 3 || n % 10 == 
6**) ensures that only numbers meeting this criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.


## Explanation of ProblemSolver_3_ejemplo_5

the program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 30 but only for the problems that are odd, divisible by 3, and have a sum of digits that is even. The conditions inside the 
loop and the helper function **sumOfDigitsIsEven** ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a 
message to the serial monitor.


## Explanation of ProblemSolver3_ejemplo_6_ExtraPoints
the program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 30 but only for the problems that are odd, divisible by 3, and have a sum of digits that is even. The conditions inside the 
loop and the helper function **sumOfDigitsIsEven** ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to 
the serial monitor.
