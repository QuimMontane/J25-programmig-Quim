# ProblemSolver4 a, b, c Explanations:
---


## ProblemSolver4 a Explanation:

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems where the digit '3' is present. 
The condition inside the loop (**if (hasDigitThree(n))**) ensures that only numbers meeting this criteria trigger the call to the resolverProblemaDibujo function, 
which then prints a message to the serial monitor.


## ProblemSolver4 b Explanation: 

The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems that are either odd or multiples of 6. The conditions inside the loop and the helper functions 
**isOdd** and **isMultipleOfSix** ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial 
monitor.


## ProblemSolver4 c Explanation:

 The program prints messages for solving problems from 1 to 100 but only for the problems where the digit sum is either 10 or 5. The condition inside the loop and the helper function 
 **digitSumIs** ensure that only numbers meeting these criteria trigger the call to the **resolverProblemaDibujo** function, which then prints a message to the serial monitor.
