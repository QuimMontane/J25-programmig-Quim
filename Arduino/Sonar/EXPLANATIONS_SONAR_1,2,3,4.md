**Sonar1:** The purpose of this code is to iterate over an array of depth measurements (**depths**) and count how many times the depth has increased. 
The result is stored in the variable **increasedDepth**. The loop runs from the second element to the last element of the array, checking if each depth is greater than the previous one. 
The final count of increased depths is stored in the **increasedDepth** variable.


**Sonar2:** This code analyzes a sequence of depth measurements stored in the array depths and counts how many times the **depth** has increased, decreased, or remained unchanged. 
The results are then printed to the serial monitor. The **loop()** function is empty as there is no continuous logic to be executed repeatedly.


**Sonar3:** This code analyzes an array of depth measurements (**depths**), calculates and stores the speeds corresponding to changes in depth, 
and then prints the counts of depth changes and the corresponding speeds through the serial communication interface. 
The counts include how many times the depth has increased, decreased, or remained unchanged. The speeds are calculated based on the differences between consecutive depth measurements.


**Sonar4:** The code analyzes a sequence of depth measurements, calculates the speed of change between consecutive measurements, and provides statistics on the changes, 
including counts of increases, decreases, and unchanged values. Additionally, it calculates and prints the minimum, maximum, and average speeds. 
The **loop()** function is empty as there is no continuous logic to be executed repeatedly. The entire logic is performed in the **setup()** function, 
which is executed once at the start of the program.
