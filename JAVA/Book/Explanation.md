This code defines a Java class called Book with several attributes: **title, author, numPag** (number of pages), **ISBN** (International Standard Book Number), and **isInKorean** (a boolean indicating whether the book is in Korean language or not).

There are two constructors defined for this class:

The default constructor Book() initializes the attributes with default values: "**noTitle**" for title, "**anonymous author**" for author, 0 for numPag, "**none**" for **ISBN**, and false for **isInKorean**.

The parameterized constructor Book(String title, String author, int numPag, String ISBN, boolean isInKorean) allows you to create a Book object with specific values for each attribute passed as arguments to the constructor.
